<h2>Code Examples</h2>

<p>This is just a bit of code for the commandline. It is used to seperate the command from the targets using arrays
```
for (int c = 0; c &lt; commBit.length; c++){
    storage = commBit[c]; //for easy comparing</p>

<pre><code>if (storage.contains(atCommand)) {
    commTarg[c] = "";
}else {
    commTarg[c] = commBit[c];
}
//the command targets are stored and returns but the command is not
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>```</p>
